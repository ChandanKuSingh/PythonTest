"""A test class is a class defined in a test module that matches test_Match or is a subclass of unittest.
    TestCase. The respective setup and teardown functions are run at the beginning and the end of the class
    of test methods. Here is the nomenclature for the class-level setup fixtures:
    
    Setup - setup_class, setupClass, setUpClass, setupAll (or setUpAll)
    TearDown -  teardown_class, teardownClass, tearDownClass, teardownAll (or tearDownAll)
    
    To demonstrate the usage of fixtures, we use Nose fixtures in different levels â€“ class, module, and 
    method.
